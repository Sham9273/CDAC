Q.3) Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in 
San Jose; the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; and the third the 
onums of all orders on October 3. Retain duplicates between the last two queries 
but eliminate any redundancies between either of them and the first.  
(Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. This is 
besides the point.)
Ans-->
mysql> select snum from salespeople
    -> where city='san jose'
    -> union
    -> select cnum from customers
    -> where city='san jose'
    -> union
    -> select distinct onum from orders
    -> where odate='1990-10-03';
